# 3D-Model-To-world.edit-command (minetest-W.E)
a simple project who able me to transfer some 3D model in multicraft (on server) without having to add any files or anything !

## how to use it:
lunch it with visual studio and chose a python environement...
### size parameters are experimentals.
it will tell you where it put the files with the commands.
 
it can be used on minetest but i think there is better way to implement 3D model in block onto minetest
just copy the list of command it give you in a command block (of mesecon)
do //1 and //2 where ever you want on the map (will be where the thing generate)
and activate the command block !

## TODO:
add an interface and make it usable by everyone:

preview of the 3D model in blocks	
and easy copy and paste in game

add color with a palette that lists all the blocks and compares them to the colors of a 3D model
need to have every multicraft texture, 
in the interface i'll make a tab to change the texture pack it use to refer the colors...

add a compatibility with stair mod.
